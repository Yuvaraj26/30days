                I am attempting to just brush up/improve my front-end skills by doing a 30 day challenge. 30 Sites in 30 days. Here it is
                and links to my versions of what I have done. I'm sure I will go back and improve on all of this over time,
                but a lot of these are placeholders until I identify what I want to do, but regardless, it gets me in the
                habit of doing a site every day, repetition is the best for this kind of development. I hope you enjoy. :-)
